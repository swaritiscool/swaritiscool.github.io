      <description>&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;The ideas in this post are influenced by James Clear (Atomic Habits), Alex Hormozi (YouTube) and one my friends who has indirectly brought forward these concepts into my life.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;cause-and-effect&#34;&gt;Cause and Effect&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our environment works on the science behind cause-and-effect. For anything to happen, for any incident to occur, there is a cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we try to achieve our missions, live up to our relentless ideals, or even just go to a coffee shop, there exists a sequence of actions which if done, will inevitably lead to us succeeding in these actions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Consumption Trap</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;negative-consumption&#34;&gt;Negative Consumption&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s world, men feel extremely isolated. They have no supportive friends, they lack authentic connections and feel left out and lagging in life. They accept mediocre (or even sub-mediocre) standards because they do not have any cause for growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They ease themselves by consuming fast food, porn, entertainment videos, movies and tv shows - all leading to virtual escapism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some times, it feels as if modern life is architected to support such vices. It is somehow structured to keep men weak and at their lowest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sacrifices</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-cost-of-achievement&#34;&gt;The Cost Of Achievement&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know a definite amount of work over a consistent period of time is necessary to achieve any goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as we want, we can&amp;rsquo;t do everything. But we can achieve anything we commit to for a long enough time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a fine line between one who tries everything at the same time and one who focusses on one thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the sacrifices made in order to achieve the high standards we set for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Great Expectations - An Essay On My Vice</title>
      <link>https://swaritiscool.github.io/posts/great-expectations/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;great-expectations--what-are-they&#34;&gt;Great Expectations : What Are They&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a substantial amount of journaling, I have come to realize that more than anybody in my life, I have the greatest expectations from myself. I hold myself to such a high standard that I have this internal desire to hold myself to that level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like a failure sometimes - perhaps because I deserve it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t perform well enough. I didn&amp;rsquo;t try or practice harder. I said some things I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have - all these things resulting to the feeling of disillusion in myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Man In The Arena</title>
      <link>https://swaritiscool.github.io/posts/men-in-the-arena/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 14:30:29 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://swaritiscool.github.io/posts/men-in-the-arena/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-the-arena&#34;&gt;What Is The Arena&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arena is life. It&amp;rsquo;s the place where a man faces success and hardship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man in the arena tries and gets beaten down by everybody. He is discouraged by his loved ones for his safety and laughed at by the ones to afraid to be in his place. He is forced to either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Become psychotic enough to fail a 100 times to win once. (which is all you need by the way)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or succumb to the words of others and become like the rest of them, critiquing the next brave one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a man desires to achieve something, formal higher ups tell him what is to be done, family tells him that he should relax a bit and his &amp;ldquo;friends&amp;rdquo; mock him for his attempt at a life beyond them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why I Will Always Work for Myself (A Short Essay)</title>
      <link>https://swaritiscool.github.io/posts/why-i-will-always-work-for-myself/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 17:02:28 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://swaritiscool.github.io/posts/why-i-will-always-work-for-myself/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently listened to this piece by Naval Ravikant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySeMzzvPVxk&#34; alt=&#34;Check It Out Here&#34;&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySeMzzvPVxk&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySeMzzvPVxk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-core-philosophy-behind-working-for-yourself&#34;&gt;The Core Philosophy Behind Working For Yourself&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the video, when most people hear the phrase &amp;ldquo;working for yourself,&amp;rdquo; they think of being their own boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, working for yourself in its most raw form means working on projects &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; find meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working on your business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting a brand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building an agency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leading a community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working For Yourself&lt;/strong&gt; means that you choose what you want to work on. No constraints, no limits. Just you and your free will.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
