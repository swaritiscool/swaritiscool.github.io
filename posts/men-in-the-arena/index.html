                <h1 id="what-is-the-arena">What Is The Arena</h1>
<p>The Arena is life. It&rsquo;s the place where a man faces success and hardship.</p>
<p>The man in the arena tries and gets beaten down by everybody. He is discouraged by his loved ones for his safety and laughed at by the ones to afraid to be in his place. He is forced to either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Become psychotic enough to fail a 100 times to win once. (which is all you need by the way)</li>
<li>Or succumb to the words of others and become like the rest of them, critiquing the next brave one.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a man desires to achieve something, formal higher ups tell him what is to be done, family tells him that he should relax a bit and his &ldquo;friends&rdquo; mock him for his attempt at a life beyond them.</p>
<p>This man, if crazy enough, leaves everything, says &ldquo;no&rdquo; to his loved ones and lives with his demons.</p>
<p>He focuses on his goals. He doesn&rsquo;t follow the cliche advice. Nor does he fall for shallow motivation.</p>
<p>He instead fights. He learns skills, he develops, he grows. Because nothing compares to the pain of what was and what will be going back unsuccessful and being mocked at again.</p>
<p>The man in the arena refers to the man who tries. The man who may stumble and fall and break. But with enough, he rises high enough to make the critics fade into irrelevance.</p>
<p>And eventually he does win. He climbs the mountain. Becomes the highest in the room.</p>
<p>And with attainment of such heights does the man realize that even if he failed a 100 more times, his soul wouldn&rsquo;t rest with the ones who never knew the taste of victory or defeat.</p>
<p>He watches over the ones who discouraged him, now envying him.</p>
<p>In the arena you can&rsquo;t make everybody happy and there is a 1 in a million chance that you win in the first ten tries. You are discouraged and lonely. Nobody understands you&hellip; until they do.</p>
<h1 id="why-i-found-this-super-important">Why I Found This Super Important</h1>
<p>This idea has played a strong role in my mind recently. I have been experiencing the initial push backs and statements from others. But I also remember the successes I have had despite them telling me this.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what keeps me going. Laying it out like this will help me reread this and remember why I have chosen this path - I am not average.</p>
<p><em>That doesn&rsquo;t make me smarter or stronger or in anyway objectively better at most metrics</em>.</p>
<p>My differentiating factor, what elevates me from the average Joe to the man I am, is the will to do.</p>
<p>I keep the time delay between what I want to achieve and working towards it very little.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most god like ability is the speed at which your dreams become reality. ~ Alex Hormozi (emphases me)</p></blockquote>
<p>Being labelled as a self obsessed individual is a complement, because some may think I am. I work for myself and the things I care about.
I workout for myself. I learn new things for myself. I eat for myself. I walk for myself.</p>
<p>But then again, this is during the times I am alone, lost and am working towards a goal of mine.</p>
<h1 id="why-i-wrote-this">Why I Wrote This</h1>
<p>One simple truth - I want to help others. I want others like me to know that they are not alone, that there is somebody out there who is just like them and is struggling equally.</p>
<p>Its to help the other guy know he isn&rsquo;t alone. To help him push past the phase of being left behind and being mocked again.</p>
<p>Here, I end this message of mine.</p>
<p>And you reader - if you read through this, if you read to the end, a quick message for you:
We will make it. In our own time but we will.</p>
<p>Until then we must keep fighting, keep growing, keep improving.</p>
